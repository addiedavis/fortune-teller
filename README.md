# Fortune Teller Game App

## Part 1
- Ask the user for the user’s first name.
- Ask the user for the user’s last name.
- Ask the user for the user’s age.
- Ask the user for the user’s birth month (as an ‘int’).
- Ask the user for the user’s favorite ROYGBIV color.
	- If the user does not know what ROYGBIV is, ask the user to enter “Help” to get a list of the ROYGBIV colors.
Ask the user for the user’s number of siblings.

## Part 2

- Base the number of years until retirement on whether the user's age is odd or even
- Use the number of siblings to determine the user's vacation home
- Use the favorite color to determine the mode of transportation
- Use the birth month to determine how much money they will have in the bank

## Part 3
- Display the user’s fortune in this format:

*[First Name]* *[Last Name]* will retire in *[# of years]* with *[bank balance]* in the bank,
a vacation home in *[location]*, and travel by *[mode of transporation]*.
Your program should be able to process input whether a user enters capital or lowercase letters.

## Optional Task

Give the user the ability to quit the program by typing “Quit” (should not be case sensitive) at any point where the program is looking for user input. The program should print “Nobody likes a quitter…” before ending.
Research while (page 115 in the Head Start book) or do/while loops and use them to check whether a user typed “Help” for favorite color, printing the list of colors each time the user types “Help”.
